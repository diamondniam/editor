import { PackageManagerTabs } from '@theme';

Kona editor is a custom wrapper around Slate.js that makes it easier to add additional functionality to this editor.
Slate.js doesn't have any plugin system, so I spent sometime building one. My goal was to make it simple, but powerful 
at the same time.

Using the Kona editor is simple, but it can take some time to set it up correctly. The reason is that I wanted to make 
the component as universal as possible, so I've tried to make each plugin less opinionated and more configurable.

## Installing

<PackageManagerTabs command="install @use-kona/editor" />

You will also need the following packages for some plugins to work:

```js
react-dnd // for DnDPlugin
```

## Using
I would recommend creating a custom wrapper around **Kona Editor** to use it in your app. This is because
most of the plugins need setting up before using, and it will be easier to do it in one place.

```tsx title="Editor.tsx"
import { KonaEditor } from "@use-kona/editor";
import { useMemo } from "react";
import { getPlugins } from "./getPlugins";
import { Descendant } from "slate";

type Props = {
  initialValue: Descendant[];
  onChange: (value: Descendant[]) => void
}

export const Editor = (props: Props) => {
  const { initialValue, onChange } = props;
  const plugins = useMemo(() => getPlugins(), []);

  return (
    <KonaEditor initialValue={initialValue} onChange={onChange} plugins={plugins} />
  )
}

```

My approach is to divide everything into a lot of small files:

```
components/
└── Editor/
    ├── Editor.tsx  // your KonaEditor wrapper
    ├── Editor.module.css  // your custom styles
    ├── getPlugins.tsx  // helper to get an array of plugins
    ├── getCommands.tsx  // list of commands for CommandsPlugin
    └── getShortcuts.tsx  // list of shortcuts for ShortcutsPlugin
```

I would also add components for some of the plugins here. Read the plugin documentation for more information.
