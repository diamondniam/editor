title: Writing a plugin
---

Each plugin is a class that implements `IPlugin` interface. All the properties are optional because your plugin can extend
some editor functionality without adding any additional blocks and vice versa.

Here are the parameters that your plugin may provide:

## `constructor`
We don't use constructor internally in Kona Editor, but you can use it to initialize store or save the settings object
to the plugin instance. This way each Editor instance will have their own settings.

## `init`
```ts
init(editor: Editor) => Editor
```
This parameter is needed when you want to override or add some methods to the Editor. You should return
the editor in the end, so the next plugin could make its own changes.

### Example
```ts
class MyPlugin implements IPlugin {
  init(editor) {
    const { insertBreak } = editor;

    editor.insertBreak = () => {
      if (/* some condition */) {
        // override default behavior
      } else {
        insertBreak(); // fallback to the default behavior
      }
    }

    return editor;
  }
}
```

## `blocks`
```ts
blocks: Block[];
```
If you want to add some blocks to the editor, this is the place. Blocks have the following parameters:

### `type`
*Required*

This is needed to store the block type in JSON. It should be unique. I like to add a static property to
the plugin and use it in other places, like other plugins.

### `render`
*Required*

```ts
render: (
  props: RenderElementProps & {
    element: CustomElement & TBlock;
  },
  editor: TEditor,
) => ReactElement | null;
```
This method is called by the Kona Editor to display your component for the user. You don't have to
check for correct type of `props.element` - Kona Editor does it automatically.

### `serialize`
*Optional*

```ts
(node: Node, children?: string) => string | undefined;
```
This method tells us how to serialize your elements to HTML.

### `deserialize`
*Optional*

```ts
export type Deserialize = (
  element: HTMLElement,
  children?: (string | Descendant)[],
) => Node | undefined;
```
This method tells us how to receive a Slate value for your element from the HTML.

### `isVoid`
*Optional, default `false`*

Tells us if your element is void.


### `isInline`
*Optional, default `false`*

Tells us if your element is void.

### `onBeforeDelete`
*Optional*

```ts
onBeforeDelete: (blocks: Block[]) => Promise<boolean>;
```
If you provide this method, we ask before deleting a node or nodes of this type.
If you return `true`, node will be deleted, otherwise it won't.

### `onDelete`
*Optional*

```ts
onDelete: (blocks: TBlock[]) => void;
```
We call this callback (if you provide it) when the node or nodes have just been deleted.
As an example, you can use it to delete a file from the server when the attachment has been deleted by the user.

## `leafs`
```ts
leafs: Leaf[]
```
Leafs are inline elements inside your text. They have only two parameters:

### `render`
*Required*

```tsx
render: (
  props: RenderLeafProps & {
    leaf: CustomText & TLeaf;
  },
  editor: T,
) => ReactElement | null;
```
This is where you tell us how to render a leaf. You have to check attributes of your leaf by yourself.

### `isVoid`
*Optional, default `false`*
Tells us if a leaf is void.

## `hotkeys`
```ts
type Hotkey = readonly [string, (event: KeyboardEvent, editor: Editor) => void];

hotkeys: Hotkey[];
```
Here you can list all of the hotkeys for your plugin and do some action when a user hits them.

## `handlers`
*Optional*
```tsx
handlers?: {
  onDrop?: (event: DragEvent, editor: Editor) => void;
  onKeyDown?: (event: KeyboardEvent, editor: Editor) => void;
  onPaste?: (event: ClipboardEvent, editor: Editor) => void;
};
```
Using the handlers object, you can alter the default Editor's behavior.

## `decorate`
*Optional*
Needed for decorating nodes and leaves. We use it in `CodeBlockPlugin` for syntax highlighting.

## `ui`
*Optional*
Used to render some additional ui for Editor. For example, main menu, floating menu or table of contents.
