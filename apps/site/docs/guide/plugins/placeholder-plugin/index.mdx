title: PlaceholderPlugin
---

## Description
This plugin shows the placeholder for the current node if it is empty.

## Usage
It has two parameters: `focused` and `unfocused` for both states of the editor. You can also
provide a list of blocks where placeholder shouldn't be shown via `ignoreNodes` parameter.

### Example
```tsx
import { KonaEditor, PlaceholderPlugin, CodeBlockPlugin } from "@kona/editor";

const placeholderPlugin = new PlaceholderPlugin({
  focused: 'Write / to open command menu',
  unfocused: 'Add a note...',
  ignoreNodes: [CodeBlockPlugin.CODE_LINE_ELEMENT],
});

return (
  <KonaEditor plugins={[placeholderPlugin]} />
)

```
